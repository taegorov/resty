# resty

Today, we begin the first of a 4-Phase build of the RESTy application, written in React. In this first phase, our goal is to setup the basic scaffolding of the application, with intent being to add more functionality to the system as we go. This initial build sets up the file structure so that we can progressively build this application in a scalable manner

## Technical Requirements

Refactor the RESTy application as follows:

    Begin with installing and running the application, making note of itâ€™s architecture
    The App component serves as the container for all sub-components of this application
        Leave this component as a Class
        The app imports an .scss file to serve as the base design for the site
        Header, Footer, Results and Form components are imported from other files using ES6 import syntax
    Each of the components use their own .scss file for styling
    The <Form> component should:
        Call back to the <App/> component via function sent down through a prop so that the app can begin the process
    The <Results/> component should show mock API results
